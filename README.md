I am a former Editor and Copywriter who graduated from Oxford University and relocated to Quebec. After learning French, I decided to master a new language and enrolled at Makers Academy, one of the most selective dev bootcamps in the world. I have been delighted by programming so far. 

I am motivated by coding's endless scope for self-improvement, and by the chances it offers to work collaboratively. 

My ideal team environment is both friendly and hard-working; it values pair programming, best practices, and continued chances to upskill and grow. I also take my Quebec integration seriously—I'm keen to find work at a francophone company where I can elevate my French from fluency to full bilingualism. 

## Skills

#### Self-starter

An Oxford degree is largely based on self-study—I graduated with the highest possible grade. Following that, I emigrated to Paris, found work as an English and Philosophy tutor, and picked up French. I then moved to Canada with my fiancée, where I have been working with two local publishing houses and a freelance marketing consultant. Now, I'm about to embark on 3 months of 70+ hour weeks at Makers Academy, with 4AM weekday starts. I'm disciplined, motivated, and not afraid to challenge myself!

#### Analytical Thinker

I have always enjoyed puzzles and logical thinking, and studying philosophy took my abilities to the next level. A deeply analytical subject, it dissects issues in a way that is very similar to programming. It demands that I think critically, question my assumptions, and submit my ideas to rigorous logical analysis. I learnt it at one of the world's top universities, and coding has let me develop its analytical approach in a way I find especially motivating. 

#### Strong Collaborator

I was trained by my university counselling service to support fellow students. This involved 30 hours of training in effective listening and assertive communication, followed by a year of supervision whilst working in the role. As a result, I can conduct myself both respectfully and straightforwardly when working collaboratively.

More recently, I have written copy to communicate effectively with customers, and I have worked with authors on poetry and novels. I have also done plenty of pair programming at Makers Academy. Pairing has been one of the surprise delights of learning to code—I am thrilled that it is now standard industry practice.

## Interests and Hobbies
- **Outdoor Sports**: I ice-skate while Montreal is snowy, and I play tennis while Montreal is sunny. 
- **Music**: I was a choral scholar at Oxford, and I played guitar regularly around the city. It's ironic that I've been playing less since moving to Montreal, but I plan to change that over the coming months.
- **Theatre**: I've always preferred plays to films, and I wish seeing them was as simple as Netflix!
