I am a former Editor and Copywriter enrolled at Makers Academy, which is among the most selective dev bootcamps in the world. After graduating from Oxford University, I moved to Quebec and picked up French—now I have decided to learn the most important language of the 21st century!

I value pair programming, best practices, and continued chances to upskill. I am motivated by coding's endless scope for self-improvement, and by the chances it offers to work collaboratively. I also take my Quebec integration seriously—I'm keen to find work at a francophone company where I can elevate my French from fluency to full bilingualism.

## Skills

#### Self-starter

An Oxford degree is largely based on self-study—I graduated with the highest possible grade. Following that, I emigrated to Paris, found work as an English and Philosophy tutor, and picked up French. I then moved to Canada with my fiancée, where I have found work with two local publishing houses and a freelance marketing consultant. And I'm now embarking on 3 months of 70+ hour weeks at Makers Academy, with 4AM weekday starts. So I possess discipline and motivation, and I'm not afraid of a challenge!

#### Analytical Thinker

I have always enjoyed puzzles and logical thinking, and studying philosophy took my abilities to the next level. At Oxford, philosophy was taught as a deeply analytical subject, and I dissected issues in a way that is very similar to the approach I take when programming. I learnt to think critically, question my assumptions, and submit my ideas to rigorous logical analysis. I was in part drawn to coding because it let me develop my analytical thinking in a new, more personally fulfilling way. 

#### Strong Collaborator

I was trained by my university counselling service to support fellow students. This involved 30 hours of training in effective listening and assertive communication, followed by a year of supervision whilst working in the role. As a result, I can conduct myself both respectfully and straightforwardly, which has been immensely valuable when working collaboratively.

More recently, I have worked with authors on poetry and novels, and I have written copy to communicate effectively with customers. I have also done plenty of programming at Makers Academy. Pairing has been one of the surprise delights of learning to code—I did not realize it was typical practice, and I am thrilled that it is now such a common industry expectation.

## Interests and Hobbies
- **Outdoor Sports**: I ice-skate while Montreal is snowy, and I play tennis while Montreal is sunny. 
- **Theatre**: I've always preferred plays to films, and I wish seeing them was as simple as Netflix!
- **Music**: I was a choral scholar at Oxford, and I played guitar regularly around the city. It's ironic that I've been playing less since moving to Montreal, but I plan to change that over the coming months.
